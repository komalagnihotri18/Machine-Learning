**Gazebo Robotics simulator with ROS :**

* This tutorial is intended for roboticists that want to have realistic simulations of their robotic scenarios. Gazebo is a 3D simulator, while ROS serves as the interface for the robot. Combining both results in a powerful robot simulator.
* With Gazebo you are able to create a 3D scenario on your computer with robots, obstacles and many other objects. Gazebo also uses a physical engine for illumination, gravity, inertia, etc. You can evaluate and test your robot in difficult or dangerous scenarios without any harm to your robot. Most of the time it is faster to run a simulator instead of starting the whole scenario on your real robot.
* Originally Gazebo was designed to evaluate algorithms for robots. For many applications it is essential to test your robot application, like error handling, battery life, localization, navigation and grasping. As there was a need for a multi-robot simulator Gazebo was developed and improved.
